# Welcome to How Terse

To get started, I recommend just searching for anything using the search bar.

<Callout type="info">

If something is out of date, google the header / step title.

</Callout>

I can't keep everything updated, and things should be descriptive enough that a google can fill in the gaps.

## Key points

-   Anything that has a TLDR is just immediately stated under the heading, no nonsense.
-   Please leave feedback if you find something wrong.

Enjoy!
