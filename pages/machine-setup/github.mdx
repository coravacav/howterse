## How to setup SSH keys

GitHub's docs are alright, but these are far more terse.

1. Check if you already have any you might want to reuse (not necessarily recommended).
    - If you have two files matching the pattern `id_*` and `id_*.pub`, those are the files you're looking for. Skip to step 3.

```zsh
ls ~/.ssh
```

2. Generate new ssh keys.

```zsh
ssh-keygen
```

You can add a password, I don't recommend it. You'd have to type it in every commit.

3. Copy SSH public key.

Any text editor / viewer works, `cat` is usually installed though.

```zsh
cat ~/.ssh/id_*.pub
```

Copy the output.

4. Add the copied SSH public key to GitHub.
